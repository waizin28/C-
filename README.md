# C++
Projects from CS368 (C++)

## Project 1 (P1)
- Focus on the basic operations of C++. Create a math library from basic principles using the basic C++ operators (+,-,/,%,type casting, etc

## Project 2 (P2)
- Focus on using a few features of the C++ Standard Library. Write a program that uses a vector to construct and manipulate a simple database of books. Each book instance will be represented as a struct, and you will be required to traverse, modify, sort, and delete from the database.

## Project 3 (P3)
- Focus on File I/O operations. Write a program that reads a file with student information and their homework scores. Manipulate that data to compute the total score and percentage for each student and then write a summary file with the computed scores for each student. Clean up some of the formatting issues from the input file.

## Project 4 (P4)
- Focus on the concepts of Object-oriented programming in C++. Create 5 classes with member variables and functions, using inheritance. 

## Project 5 (P5)
- Focus on using a few features of C++ operator overloading as well as continuing your exploration of classes.
